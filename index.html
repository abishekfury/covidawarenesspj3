        <h4>Evaluation of COVID-19 m-Health apps: An analysis of the methods of app usability testing during a global pandemic</h4>
        <h1>What is a Coronavirus?</h1>
        <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

            Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age. </p>
        <p>The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the disease and how the virus spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently. Get vaccinated when it’s your turn and follow local guidance.

            The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols. It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and to stay home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell.</p>
        <h1> Introduction</h1>
        <p>The 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a human viral infection that affects the respiratory system, varying in its severity to the infected. During the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of cases steadily grew around the world [
            
            ,
            
            . Because of the disease's quick progression and society's lack of understanding of its behavioral patterns, an immediate response was required to address the public-health crisis [
            
            . The World Health Organization (WHO) designated COVID-19 a public health emergency of worldwide concern, urging all countries to work together to prevent the disease's fast spread [
            
            . Various governments implemented substantial preventive measures, such as social distancing and quarantine of people at direct risk, to reduce the spreading of the COVID-19</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Due to varying severity of the disease, some patients need hospitalization for their symptoms, but many others do not. In order to recover fully, however, all patients should implement self-care and self-monitoring at home; current activities in this area include adhering to health protocols and following self-care recommendations [
                [8]
                , 
                [9]
                , 
                [10]
                ]. Public knowledge and sensitivity to COVID-19 needed to be improved, and people needed be educated about the significance of self-care through appropriate preventative measures. With these considerations, mobile apps can be of great help [
                11
                ,
                12
                ].</p>
                <h1>Methods</h1>
                <p>This study addresses the following research question: “In studies evaluating or analyzing governmental apps for COVID-19, which methods did researchers use for evaluating the usefulness and/or suitability of the pertinent app?” For obtaining a pertinent answer, we have conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify and analyze the investigations into the usability evaluation of mobile apps developed in the COVID-19 era. This literature review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) [
                    25
                    ] as follows.</p>
                    <h1>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</h1>
                    <p>The following inclusion criteria were used to choose related studies from the database used:
                        1)
                        An article must be either an original article or a short article published in English in a peer-reviewed journal. Therefore, reports, letters to the editor, review articles, and meta-analyses were excluded.
                        
                        2)
    
                        An article must have analyzed and evaluated at least one mobile app that was launched and/or supported by a government. Therefore, articles dealing with non-governmental apps were excluded.</p>
                    <h1>Databases and search method</h1>
                    <p>PubMed, OVID, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus (2019–2022) databases were searched for studies reporting the usability evaluation of official government mobile apps developed in the COVID-19 era. This study used broad search terms and conducted a nested search. To make the search even deeper, we also reviewed all the sources referred to in the articles selected for the study. The search terms was as follows: (COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 OR 2019nCoV OR HCoV-19) AND (Usability OR Evaluation OR Analysis OR Assessment) AND (App OR Application OR Mobile app OR Smartphone). 
                        Appendix 1
                         (a supplementary file) presents an example of a search procedure (

                        <p>A PRISMA flow diagram summarizes the results of the screening (
                            Fig. 1
                            ). The primary search resulted in 726 papers; after removing duplicates (the same articles indexed in more than one database), the number dropped to 276 potentially relevant papers. Their titles and abstracts were analyzed in terms of the exclusion criteria, and 247 items were excluded. To determine whether the remaining 29 papers met the inclusion criteria, we read and analyzed their full texts. We also analyzed their references, but none of them met the inclusion criteria. Finally, the screening process led to the inclusion of 11 papers in the study (
                            Table 1
                            ).</p>

                            <p>Using the heuristic method, one achieves a fast and up to a high level (at least 70%) of accuracy and reliability [
                                26
                                ]. Nielsen, the designer of the heuristic method, stated that with the help of five experts, at least 70% of user interface usability evaluations can be achieved [
                                37
                                ]. Thus, usability evaluation can be performed quickly and with minimal resources with this method [
                                46
                                ,
                                47
                                ]. Despite this, heuristic method evaluation is most effective when used before the app is designed and developed [
                                37
                                ,
                                48
                                ]. However, some studies suggest that the heuristic method should be used during implementation [
                                49
                                ,
                                50
                                ]. Even so, the absence of users of the app to comment on its usability and the presence of only experts evaluating the app may not seem logical, but it speeds up the evaluation, despite the fact that the absence of users in the app evaluation is one of the disadvantages of the heuristic method </p>
                                <p>Comparative analysis involves comparing items and identifying their similarities and differences [
                                    40
                                    ]. In fact, comparative analysis allows researchers to better understand and respond to the issue [
                                    59
                                    ]. Comparative studies often incorporate multiple disciplines [
                                    60
                                    ]. Zimmermann et al. [

                                    ] used comparative analysis to compare the government of India app (Aarogya Setu) with other apps. The use of comparative analysis of mobile apps with other similar apps and comparing the results of the multiple interview analyses between each other can help us it to better understand the issue and form strategies in response to questions [
                                    30

                                    ]. However, the comparative approach has various disadvantages as well. Often, researchers have multiple theories that fit the same data, and this is a major concern [
                                    [61]

                                    ]. To test theoretical relations, researchers must collect valid and reliable data for the case they have chosen [

                                    ]. The quality of results will be undermined if this problem is not adequately solved [
                                    61
                                    ,

                                    ]. Additionally, if inadequate data is available, it may be impossible to apply the comparative approach [

                                    ]. Due to the fact that no two properties are the same, adjustments must be made [

                            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                            <p>Recall that our study addresses a research question about evaluating methods, specifically in studies evaluating the usefulness and/or suitability of the pertinent app governmental apps for COVID-19. Following a PRISMA scheme, we have reviewed 11 articles analyzing 40 official mobile apps in 41 countries. This study shows that researchers used different methods to evaluate the useability of apps developed by governments during the COVID-19 era. Some researchers are seeking the implementation of the evaluation sample in a smaller format for a more general evaluation.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The evaluation of the user interface and user experience of these apps was vital to ensuring they could be adopted by a diverse audience. It should be noted that such efforts to reach a good and high level of how to design and develop apps can be effective. Notably, most authors pursued emphasizing the strengths of these apps, rather than highlighting any weaknesses. Based on this review, we find that all research methods can examine apps usefulness very well, but only if the appropriate methods is selected to align with the app(s) being studied.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Finally, we admit that It would be helpful to have a greater amount of details on each app, each author(s), each stakeholder, through various demographic characteristics and mobile app expertise. We recommend that in future apps production and evaluations, much more information be given. Moreover, researchers should emphasize the particular strengths of evaluated apps, the constraints common to the apps, or how researchers choose to downplay them in their evaluation findings. We may also recommend much more correlation studies, throughout, say, multidimensional evaluation criteria. These would lead to add helpful resources, not only for apps evaluators, but also for those who design apps, as well as researchers and policymakers at large.</p>
